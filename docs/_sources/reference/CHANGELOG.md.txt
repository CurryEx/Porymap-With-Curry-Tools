# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project somewhat adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).  The MAJOR version number is bumped when there are breaking changes in the pret projects.

The **"Breaking Changes"** listed below are changes that have been made in the decompilation projects (e.g. pokeemerald), which porymap requires in order to work properly. If porymap is used on a project that is not up-to-date with the breaking changes, then porymap will likely break or behave improperly.

## [Unreleased]
### Breaking Changes
- Proper support for pokefirered's clone objects was added, which requires the changes made in [pokefirered/#484](https://github.com/pret/pokefirered/pull/484).

### Added
- Add Copy/Paste for metatiles in the Tileset Editor.
- Add new features to the scripting API, including the ability to display message boxes and user input windows, set overlay opacity, get/set map header properties, read tile pixel data, and set blocks or metatile attributes using a raw value.
- Add button to copy the full metatile label to the clipboard in the Tileset Editor.
- Add option to not open the most recent project on launch.
- Add color picker to palette editor for taking colors from the screen.

### Changed
- Overhauled the region map editor, adding support for tilemaps, and significant customization. Also now supports pokefirered.
- If an object event is inanimate, it will always render using its first frame.
- Only log "Unknown custom script function" when a registered script function is not present in any script.
- Unused metatile attribute bits that are set are preserved instead of being cleared.
- The wild encounter editor is automatically disabled if the encounter JSON data cannot be read
- Metatiles are always rendered accurately with 3 layers, and the unused layer is not assumed to be transparent.
- `object_event_graphics_info.h` can now be parsed correctly if it uses structs with attributes.
- The selection is no longer reset when pasting events. The newly pasted events are selected instead.
- Palette editor ui is updated a bit to allow hex and rgb value input.

- New maps can be created using existing layouts by right-clicking on an existing layout folder in the map list panel when sorted by "Layout".
- The map list panel now has "expand-all" and "collapse-all" buttons.
- Events without sprites are now partially transparent so the underlying metatile can be seen. (Warps, signs, etc.)
- Changed the Trainer checkbox to a combobox, since there are actually 3 valid values for the trainer type.
- Multiline comments are now respected when parsing C defines.
- The tiles image in the tileset editor will no longer flip according to the x/y flip checkboxes. The individual tile selection still flips, though.

### Fixed
- Fix bug where smart paths could be auto-enabled, despite the checkbox being disabled.
- Fix crash that could occur when changing the palette id in the tileset palette editor.
- Fix crash that could occur when shrinking the number of metatiles in a tileset.
- Fix bug where exported tile images from Advance Map were not handled correctly due to Advance Map using incorrect file extensions.

### Added
- Add `porymap.project.cfg` config file to project repos, in order to house project-specific settings, such as `base_game_version=pokeemerald`.
- Write all logs to `porymap.log` file, so users can view any errors that porymap hits.
- Changelog

### Changed
- Add `porymap.cfg` base config file, rather than using built-in system settings (e.g. registry on Windows).
- Properly read/write map headers for `pokeemerald`.
- Overhauled event editing pane, which now contains tabs for each different event. Events of the same type can be iterated through using the spinner at the top of the tab. This makes it possible to edit events that are outside the viewing window.

### Fixed
- Creating new hidden-item events now uses a valid default flag value.
- Fix bug where tilesets were sometimes not displaying their bottom row of metatiles.
- Fix bug where porymap crashes on startup due to missing map headers.
- Fix tileset editor crash that only happened on macOS.
